 <h1>Test Case Description for <em>sort columns</em></h1> 
 <h2>Purpose</h2> 
 <p>This testcase is designed to verify that the column sorting feature works properly.</p> 
 <h2>Initial Conditions</h2> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You must have used the installation of the browser you plan to test.</li> 
  <li>If you have not, browse around some, then come back. Or run the <a href="gomenu-list.html">gomenu-list</a> test first.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h2>Steps/Description</h2> 
 <p>Select Go|History. This is most easily tested by using the View|Group By|None setting but not strictly necessary.</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li>Click on the "Title" column once.</li> 
  <li>Click on the "Title" column a second time.</li> 
  <li>Click on the "Title" column a third time.</li> 
  <li>Click on the "Location" column once, and a second time.</li> 
  <li>Click on the "Last Visited" column once, and a second time.</li> 
 </ol> 
 <h2>Expected Results</h2> 
 <p>By step:</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li>The bookmarks should sort into alphabetical order, by Title.</li> 
  <li>The bookmarks should sort into reverse-alphabetical order, by Title.</li> 
  <li>The bookmarks should sort into "natural" order (the way they were originally sorted).</li> 
  <li>The bookmarks should sort into order by Location and then the reverse of that order.</li> 
  <li>The bookmarks should sort into order by Last Visited and then the reverse of that order.</li> 
 </ol>
