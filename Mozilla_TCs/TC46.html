 <h1>Test Case Description for save-state</h1> 
 <h2>Purpose</h2> 
 <p>This basic testcase is designed to verify that bookmarks are added and deleted from the personal</p> 
 <h2>Initial Conditions</h2> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You must have a bookmarks file.</li> 
  <li>To promote consistency, you may choose to use the default set of <a href="netscape-bookmarks.html">Netscape Seamonkey Bookmarks</a>, which I use. I have also provided the default <a href="mozilla-bookmarks.html">Mozilla bookmarks</a> file.</li> 
  <li>You also have the option to use this <a href="large-bookmarks.html">very large bookmarks file</a>.</li> 
  <li>You must also <a href="javascript:sidebar.addPanel('Bookmarks', 'chrome://bookmarks/content/bm-panel.xul', '');"> customize</a> your sidebar to include a bookmarks panel.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h2>Steps/Description</h2> 
 <ol> 
  <li>Select Bookmarks|Manage Bookmarks.</li> 
  <li>Click on disclosure triangles to open/close several folders.</li> 
  <li>Remember which were open/closed.</li> 
  <li>Do the same for bookmarks folders in the bookmarks sidepanel. (Do not close Manage Bookmarks)</li> 
  <li>Quit the browser (alternately, induce a crash)</li> 
  <li>Launch the browser and open the sidebar and Manage Bookmarks.</li> 
 </ol> 
 <h2>Expected Results</h2> 
 <ol> 
  <li>The bookmarks tree should have the same shape, ie folders that were closed should still be closed and those that were open should still be open.</li> 
  <li>This should be true for the bookmarks in the sidepanel as well.</li> 
 </ol>
